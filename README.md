# Lox in Rust

Lox is a small, dynamically typed programming language originally designed by Bob Nystrom for the _Crafting Interpreters_ book. This project is variation of the original [clox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) written in Rust.

Lox is inspired by languages like JavaScript, Python, and Lua, emphasizing simplicity and expressiveness over performance. It features:

- **Dynamic typing**
- **Automatic memory management**
- **First-class functions and closures**
- **Classes and inheritance**
- **Lexical scoping**
- **REPL and script modes**

This implementation serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for experimenting with interpreter design, garbage collection, and future compilation targets in Rust.
